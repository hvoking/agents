# Ciudades feministas

The first ever Feminist Urban Atlas that is trained by communities to actively participate in designing cities through a feminist lens by The Gendered City. We are trying to empower individuals especially marginalised individuals to shape urban landscapes that prioritize hashtag#genderequality, hashtag#inclusivity, and hashtag#socialjustice. We believe in the collective wisdom and diverse perspectives of people to design their cities. The FEM. Urban Atlas aims to revolutionize hashtag#participatory feminist urban design practices and pave the way for more inclusive and equitable cities of the future.
